// Import any necessary modules or dependencies
// For example, if you're using Express.js:
// const express = require('express');

// Define your controller
const voteController = {
  // Define your controller methods
  // For example, a method to handle a POST request to vote
  vote: (req, res) => {
    // Your logic for processing the vote
    // For example, you might receive the user's vote in req.body
    const { vote } = req.body;

    // Process the vote, for example, save it to a database
    // Respond with a success or error message
    res.send(`Vote received: ${vote}`);
  },

  // Another method, for example, to get the total number of votes
  getTotalVotes: (req, res) => {
    // Your logic to get the total number of votes
    // For example, query a database or calculate it based on some data

    // Respond with the total number of votes
    res.send('Total votes: 100');
  },

  // Add more methods as needed for your application
};

// Export the controller so it can be used in other parts of your application
module.exports = voteController;
